First release of ps2-ish remote GDB, for Win32 running Cygwin. I've included a patch so Linux users can give that a go.
You'll need to get and build ps2gdb from the ps2dev.org cvs to play with this. Released under the GPL, see COPYING
for details.

This is only a proof of concept build, hacked up mercilessly, see the disclaimer.

I've insterted debug printfs too, making it ugly. To use, do the following:-

1. Copy mips64r5900-sf-elf-gdb.exe to you ee/bin folder (e.g. on my system it's c:\cygwin\usr\local\ps2dev\ee\bin).
2. Make a link with "ln -s mips64r5900-sf-elf-gdb.exe ee-gdb.exe" and you should be ready to go.

There's a ps2.cmd command file there to try out. It loads the stub, inserts a breakpoint and continues execution to that
breakpoint. Launch with "ee-gdb -x ps2.cmd".

Here's that disclaimer.
