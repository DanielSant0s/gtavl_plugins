PS2KLSI
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a ps2ip driver for the NetGear EA101 USB Ethernet Adapater.
The EA101 uses a Kawasaki chipset which is available in a number of
adapters.  This driver will currently only recognise the EA101.  

The driver is based on and includes code from Bill Paul's BSD driver. It
is also based on and includes code from the standard ethernet lwip driver
by Adam Dunkels. Both authors released there code under a BSD style license.
In keeping with those authors, the driver is also released under a BSD style
license.

The main reason for releasing this code is to assist others in developing
other drivers for use with ps2ip.  If you require any assistance or pointers
in developing drivers please contact me.

Oobles.
