PS2 SIO Shell
Copyright (c) TyRaNiD, Pixel 2005

Not much of a readme to be honest. This is a simple shell program for use on the PS2
over SIO. When built and executed (using ps2link/naplink etc) it gives you the ability
to halt the EE, dump memory, set breakpoints, do single stepping etc. Nothing too 
fancy but could be useful once in a while.

BUILDING:
To build you need the latest version of ps2sdk from CVS and also the latest build of 
Pixel's ps2-packer. Without these you wont get far.

In the source dir type "make", that should be all you need to do.

USAGE:

Setup your serial console, execute the elf file on the PS2. "SIOSHELL Installed" should
be printed to your console. Now start your program you want to debug/monitor, while
it is running hit a key on the serial console and the shell should appear. Type 
"help" in the shell to see the command list and type "help [command]" to get a slightly
more detailed usage. Type "exit" to exit the shell.

NOTE: Try and avoid executing commands via naplink/ps2link while the shell is active.
Also once the shell has been installed you do not need to install it again unless you
reboot the machine.

That is all...

Thx to Herben for many many useful tips :)

Greetz to all the usual shower.
