  * Added sif_load_elf, sif_load_elf_part and sif_load_module_encrypted 
    to eeloadfile code.
  * Added SetVTLBRefillHandler, SetVCommonHandler, k_DeleteThread and
    k_TerminateThread system calls.
  * Updated iop/include/fileio.h (thanks to Florin Sasu)
  * Minor bugfixes

27-12-2002 - Nicholas Van Veen (nickvv@xtra.co.nz)

  * Released version 1.9
  * Fixed HUGE bug in fileio.c, which was restricting reads to sizes of a
    multiple of 16 bytes.
  * Added some EE system calls

5-11-2002 - Nicholas Van Veen (nickvv@xtra.co.nz)

  * Cleaned up library structure (moved libpad into seperate directory, etc)
  * Added libmc - a partial EE-side memory card access library. I intend to
    write an example memory card program soon (just need to get a memory card
    icon which can be distributed freely).
  * Additions to IOP sysclib.h and stdio.h

4-11-2002 - David Ryan (oobles@hotmail.com)

  * Removed "sce" prefix from Sif and Sd functions on IOP.
  * Added missing sifman and sifcmd functions on IOP imports.  Function names
    added from imports.txt from Herben's IRX tool.
  * Removed sifman prototypes from kernel.h on IOP.
  * Added sifman.h and added a couple more prototypes based on EE functions.

28-10-2002 - David Ryan (oobles@hotmail.com)

  * Released version 1.8,  the dual ps2lib/sjeep coming of age version. :)

26-10-2002 - David Ryan (oobles@hotmail.com)

  * Changed default build location in Makefile.prefs to $(PS2LIB)
  * Changed make all to include making samples and utils.
  * Added the LICENSE file
  * Added new 'lib' target to Makefile
  * Modified README to include introduction and license info.
  * Fixed iop/makefile to correctly include sample directory.
  * Added pad.h, pad.c and pad example. Compiles but needs work.


25-10-2002 - Nicholas Van Veen (nickvv@xtra.co.nz)

  * Replaced makefiles. Should make the library much easier to manage.
  * Added Makefile.include and Makefile.template to the ee/ directory. These files
    are meant to ease the process of starting a new project by providing a working
    makefile setup, which is compatible with ps2lib.
  * Added ee/startup directory, and crt0.s and linkfile to this directory.
  * Renamed "sbrk" function to "ps2_sbrk".
  * Removed bzero macro in tamtypes.h to fix parse error generated by including string.h
  * Modified IOP example code so it would compile on "new generation" IOP compilers (ie: ones
    with Karmix's patches applied).
  * Removed iop_lib.s, as it is no longer needed.
  * Added function prototypes to sifcmd.h, sifrpc.h.
  * Modified thread_attr structure in ee/include/kernel.h, also gave names to syscall parameters.
  * Added ChangeLog (this file), made first entry :)
  * Updated readme file
