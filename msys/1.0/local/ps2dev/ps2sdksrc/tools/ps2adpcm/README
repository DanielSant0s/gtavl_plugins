========================================                                    

What it does:
* Convert mono or stereo streams to ADPCM, for use with the ps2snd IRX.
* Convert looping or single-shot voice samples to adpcm.

(check out the ps2snd README for more infomation about output format)

This does more than the current adpenc, and has a much cleaner ADPCM encoder, and is designed to work with te ps2snd IRX.

==================

Probably hates big endian systems.
Might hate 64bit systems too.
Raw PCM sucks!

libaudio file for PCM input, maybe some other library(s) too.
