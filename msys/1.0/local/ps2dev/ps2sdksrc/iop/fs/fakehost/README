fakehost is a filesystem driver for the IOP processor.

It accepts one parameter, this parameter is a path to an iomanx filesystem, for example pfs0:/
When run, it will install a filesystem driver to redirect the host: device to the given device's directory.
It also installs a naplink style rpc interface, for programs that 
require that to run.
This together with the host drive is sufficient to allow most programs
designed to run from one of the loader utilities to function in this
environment.

Usage is: fakehost.irx pfs0:/dir/

Example: from ps2link, make sure the needed support modules are loaded and a partition mounted. 
Then do, from pksh: execiop host:fakehost.irx pfs0:/dir

OR alternatively call it with the parameters from EE via loadmodule.


NOTES:
This does not handle any mounting of partitions, it is designed to accept
a pfs device as the parameter. The calling program must do any 
required setup first.

This module relies upon:
iomanx and fileXio IOP modules.

It is also advised that you load:
ps2dev9, ps2atad,ps2hdd and ps2fs  
for hdd access.
