AHX Player v1.0b
================

This is an AHX replayer for the IOP. Based on source by
Dexter/Abyss and utilising LKZ's FreeSD framework.

It has been designed to compile with PS2SDK (tested with
ps2sdk v1.0alpha). The src directory contains the IRX
sourcecode and AHX player sourcecode (iop dir) and an
EE side RPC interface (ee dir).

The compiled IRX is completely standalone and does not
require either LIBSD or FREESD.

I will include some example code to make using the IRX
easy to understand (it's quite simple).

Thanks to Emoon, LKZ and NiK for their help with this
project.

Please consult the included LICENSE for information
on the AFL license that applies to this work.
