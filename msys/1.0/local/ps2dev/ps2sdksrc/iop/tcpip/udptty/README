UDPTTY is a very simple console for sending TTY output (printf()) over the
official PS2 network adapter (SMAP) to a Pukklink-compatible client.  It's most
useful in situations where the IOP must be reset, but you would still like to
see your printf()'s make it to the Pukklink client output window.

To use UDPTTY, modify the Makefile so that UDPTTY_ETH_SRC contains your SMAP's
hardware (MAC) address, and UDPTTY_IP_ADDR_SRC contains your PS2's IP address.
If you don't know your SMAP's MAC address, you can use 0xff for each value, and
it should still work.  UDPTTY_IP_ADDR_SRC can be any valid IP address on your
network.

You must have previously loaded iomanX.irx and ps2dev9.irx in order to use
udptty.irx.
